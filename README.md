# Contribution Guide

<h3> Note: If you have already created your branch once, the next time you work on the same branch do not forget to do the following:<br></h3>

1. Go to https://github.com/anishkn04/hack-a-ton
2. Select your branch
3. If there is a `_ commits behind main` then click on it and create Pull Request. If there is no such thing, you can simply start working.

<h3>Now you can start working again<br>
Also, if the branch already exists, the third point in `Get Started: Step 3` will be simply "git push"
</h3>

# Get Started

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/anishkn04/hack-a-ton.git`

2. Checkout to your branch: `git checkout -b yourName` (Use your name for the branch name, example: anish, nishan, etc)

3. Make your changes and do:
    - `git add . (or your specific file/folder name instead of .)`
    - `git commit -m "Short message of what you did"`
    - `git push --set-upstream origin yourBranchName`<br>
    (This is for the first time if there is no branch in the upstream)<br>
    (If you work on the same branch next time, you can just do `git push`)

4. Then go to repo: https://github.com/anishkn04/hack-a-ton, select your branch.
