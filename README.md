2. If you had created your branch but not currently in it, `git checkout yourBranchName`.

3. After you are in your branch, make changes, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Message"` and `git push`

# Get Started

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/anishkn04/hack-a-ton.git`

2. Checkout to your branch: `git checkout -b yourName` (Use your name for the branch name, example: anish, nishan, etc)<br>
                                           ^Only if you have not created your branch yet. If you have done already, dont put `-b`
3. Make your changes and do:
    - `git add . (or your specific file/folder name instead of .)`
    - `git commit -m "Short message of what you did"`
    - `git push --set-upstream origin yourBranchName`<br>
    (This is for the first time if there is no branch in the upstream)<br>
    (If you work on the same branch next time, you can just do `git push`)
